# Binary Classification with CARET package in R
This R script can be easily reused to perfom binary classification by CARET package in R. Machine Learning algorithms' plots, results and resampling plots are exported.
Few guided adjustments are required to easily reuse the script with any dataset. Coding rationale and script's main code chunks explanation are given by a pdf report.
The sample dataset is [Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).

# Binary Classification with CARET package in R
This R script can be easily reused to perfom binary classification by CARET package in R. Machine Learning algorithms' plots, results and resampling plots are exported.
Few guided adjustments are required to easily reuse the script with any dataset. Coding rationale and script's main code chunks explanation are given by a pdf report.
The sample dataset is [Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).

Project's files are:
1. `figs` folder contains plots of confusion matrices, ROC curves, correlation, models' performances and variables' importance;
2. `Binary_Classification_with_CARET_package_in_R.pdf` is the report which explains the project's rationale and main R script's code chunks;
3. `Binary_Classification_with_CARET.R` performs 9 Machine Learning algorithms using CARET package;
4. `Console output.txt` stores total script's time elapsed and detailed information about algorithms' execution;
5. `Models' results.xlsx` tables all algorithms' performance indicators which are taken into account;
6. `Time Elapsed.png` plots how algorithms' total elapsed time is distributed;
7. `heart disease.xlsx` is the source dataset file.
